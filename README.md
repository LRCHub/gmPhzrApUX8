# arai tasuku – Time passing Bell / ベルの時計は壊れない

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
One thousand times
I see your face again
I touch the old wound in the end of your pink
heart
Said one of the passengers
A thing that one is looking for is already there
In my words, in my worlds
But all things change now
Never sure   to lie awake
Lake reflect
I want to sleep cuddling with you
Like green, like a breeze
And then
I feel breeze, I can breathe
Years that seemed telescoped like time in a
dream
One is looking for is already there
In my worlds
I see a red apple fall from the tree
The sky suddenly divide
Like a lute
Delete the poison
You know primary instinct
Take care…　the sky suddenly divide
Lonesome eyes
Please wash the world with a youthful madness
Hitch your wagon to a star
